This repository is for the basic freertos with stm32f4 with trace debugging functionality(working on it!)
1. Create a basic freertos working process structure . 2 tasks are created . First is for blinking LED and the other one is for just writing to the USART port.
2. Next task would be to create a template from the above structure so that we have a working template every time we need to start with a project.
3. There are some issues with ISR. We need to address those in the next project.
